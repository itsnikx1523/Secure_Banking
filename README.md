## 📌 SecureBanking

**SecureBanking** is a security-focused project designed to demonstrate methods for safeguarding modern banking applications against common vulnerabilities. The project simulates real-world scenarios in which financial systems face threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), insecure authentication, and misconfigured cloud services.  

### 🔒 Key Features
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Automated scanning for OWASP Top 10 risks in web-based banking modules.  
- **Secure Authentication**: Implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA) and encrypted session management.  
- **Data Protection**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive transactions using AES and RSA.  
- **Cloud Security**: Hardened configurations for cloud-hosted banking services (AWS/GCP), including IAM role checks and secure storage policies.  
- **DevSecOps Integration**: CI/CD pipeline with embedded security checks to prevent insecure code deployments.  
- **Threat Monitoring**: Log analysis and anomaly detection to identify suspicious activity in real time.  

### 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python, Go, SQL  
- **Frameworks/Tools**: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, OWASP ZAP, GitHub Actions  
- **Databases**: MySQL/PostgreSQL with secure query handling  
- **Cloud**: AWS/GCP for infrastructure security testing  

### 🎯 Objectives
- Showcase practical approaches to **banking security automation**.  
- Provide a learning resource for students and professionals interested in **cybersecurity in fintech**.  
- Demonstrate how **DevSecOps practices** can be applied to financial applications.
